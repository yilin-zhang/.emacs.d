My personal Emacs configuration. It's aimed at note taking and document writing.

I'm an Emacs beginner, so the configuration is far from excellent.

Default agenda file path: =~/agenda.org=

Thanks to Harrison who helps me make the logo, and [[https://github.com/seagle0128/.emacs.d/][Centaur Emacs]] that gives me ideas to improve my configuration.
